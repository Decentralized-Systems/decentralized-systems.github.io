title: Getting Started
---

Digging into the topic of Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies and starting to develop your own Dapp can be overwhelming. For this reason, we collected some material for you to getting started.

## Tutorials 👉
To gain a first impression and hands-on experience on Blockchain and Dapp-Development, we recommend you to search for tutorials in regards to Smart Contracts. Check out common platforms such as [Coursera][Coursera], [edX][edX], [Coursetro][Coursetro] or YouTube tutorials. Most of the courses are even free of charge. 

A good point to start are the following tutorials: 
* [Coursetro: Developing Ethereum Smart-Contracts for Beginners][Dapp-development]
    * make sure to have [node.js][nodejs] installed

## Kialo Debate 📢
Read and join our
[Kialo.com debate][Kialo-Debate]
where we discuss arguments for and against different distributed ledger technologies. 

## Karma App ⭕️
We started developing our own toy project, a Karma App with the goal to put emphasis on good things happening. You can see the progress and contribute to it in our [git repository][git-repo].
