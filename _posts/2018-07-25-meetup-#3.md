We moved the meetup from Caf√© Kittel to Papillion. After some Wi-Fi problems, we set up a [Metamask][metamask] wallet, explored the user interface of the respective Google Chrome plugin, and briefly discussed the [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)][ens].

Because we finally want to start learning about decdentralized app (DApp) development we chose a sandbox project.
We agreed on exploring a social media app in which Karma can be send as a token of appreciation and gratitude. 
The aim of the app is to appreciate altruistic and sustainable behaviour of others and focus attention on good things happening.
