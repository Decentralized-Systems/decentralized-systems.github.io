We moved the meetup from Caf√© Kittel to Papillion. After some problems Wifi problems, we set up a [Metamask][metamask] wallet, explored the user interface of the respective Google Chrome plugin, and briefly discussed the [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)][ens].


Because we finally want to start learning about decdentralized app (DApp) development we chose a sandbox project.
We agreed on exploring a social media app in which Karma can be send as a token of appreciation and gratitude. 
The greater aim of the app is to create awareness on good things happening.
