In this meetup, we discussed [last weeks homework]({% post_url 2018-08-12-homework-smart-contract %}).
We took a close look at the [Solidity language][solidity-docs] annd [Remix Solidity IDE][remix] and learned how to write and debug smart contracts. 
For the next meetup, We agreed that we want to think more about problems related to the Karma-App and how to solve them in a decentralized way.
