title:  "Meetup #2: Exploring Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)"

In the second meetup, we explored decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
DAOs provide new collaborative environments and governance system to achieve (holographic) consensus in organizations of any scale. The topic is also tightly connected with the topic of prediction markets.

The meetup started with a talk by Michael about [DAOstack][daostack] - an operating system for collective intelligence. 
DAOstack provides the building blocks (schemes and global constraints) to build scalable and resilient organizations achieving holographic consensus. 
This is achieved by monetarization of attention and use of predictions markets.
The concepts are best described in the [DAOstack whitepaper][daostack-whitepaper].

Later, we explored the interfaces of [DAOstack][daostack] and of the[Aragon Network][aragon], another DAO implementation.

If DAOstack leaves the beta phase, we will think about using it to organize our meetup as a DAO. 
The plan is to allocate resources and reward ourselves reputation for preparing talks, selecting topics, or contributions of other kinds (organizing rooms, technical equipment, acquiring new participants etc.).
