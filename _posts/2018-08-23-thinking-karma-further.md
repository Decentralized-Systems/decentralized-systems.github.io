Imagine a decentralized social media app in which the users can send each other Karma. In this app, Karma is a symbol of appreciation and gratitude. 
The main goal is to put emphasis on good things happening and to motivate action that is benificial for the society.
The basis mechanics of sending and recieving karma are described in [homework #1]({% post_url 2018-08-12-homework-smart-contract %}).

It could also be desirable to distinguish between personal and institutional accounts. An institution could be e.g. a fair trade shop or a company. 
A company with good karma might be more attractive for customers and employees.
It could also be possible that people follow/join an institution and so that they share the Karma as a collective.
Furthermore, the temporal flow of Karma could be visualized on a map.

Think about the following questions:
* What could be an incentive for using the app?
* What are weaknesses in the karma mechanics and are there ways to solve them?
