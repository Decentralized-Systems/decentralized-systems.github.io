In the beginning of the Meetup, we discussed some organizational matters. We agreed, that we want to write meetup protocols and to put them on this website. This should help members who are unable to participate to keep pace and save us time at the beginning of each Meetup session.

We then discussed the Karma-App and the technology stack we want to use:
* Javascript
    * Truffle
    * Angular
* Solidity (we will eventually switch to Vyper when it is supported by the Truffle Suite or similar libraries)

The Karma-App project we will be based on a [template git repository][dapp-starter] for DApps which we will fork.

Next, we discussed some basic design decisions regarding the nature of Karma.
In this context, we have decided on a 
[homework assignment]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-08-12-homework-karma.md %}) that we will discuss at the beginning of the next meetup.
