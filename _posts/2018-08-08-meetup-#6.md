In this meetup, we discussed technical, conceptual, and design-related issues of the Karma-App. 

In the discussion we agreed, that the technical difficulties would be solved in the future due to progress in the blockchain area.
We also decided to put the remaining conceptual and design-related problems aside and simply dive into the topic. 
Therefor, the app has the goal to enable interaction between people and Karma serves as a token of unconditional gratitude and appreciation.
We have also decided to split the development of the app into several individual/small group projects so that everyone can get involved with their own interests.

Furthermore, we are working towards becoming a student initiative of RWTH Aachen.
